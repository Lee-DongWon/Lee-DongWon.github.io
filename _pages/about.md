I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineeing at Seoul National University.My advisor is [Yongsoo Song](https://yongsoosong.github.io) and my research interests are in Cryptography, Privacy and Security. In these days, I'm especially interested in homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation.

Before studying in Seoul National University, I studied and obtained Bachelor's degree in Sungkyunkwan University, from 2014. During the course, my major was mathematics and computer science. I worked as an undergraduate research student with [Hyoungshick Kim](https://seclab.skku.edu/people/hyoungshick-kim/), from 2019 to 2020. I also did an intership in [CSIRO Data 61](https://data61.csiro.au/), from September to December 2019.
